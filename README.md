# School_District_Analysis
**Overview of the school district analysis:**

Maria asked us to put together an analysis of passing test scores for reading and math for local high schools.  We were also tasked with identifying total school budge, per student budget, and school type. After we completed the initial analysis of the overall passing we were notified that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. It is suspected that the nineth grade class at Thomas High school has irregularities in their test results. Maria has asked me to remove those scores from the overall analysis and report back how the scores have changed 

**Results**

If we format the results to one decimal pointe the results are not affected by removing Thomas Highschool 9th grade. For this case we would want to view the average further out to show the difference. We do see that for the medium schools the average passing grade has dropped slightly. The first graph is before removing the 9th grade class and the second is after removing the 9th grade class
