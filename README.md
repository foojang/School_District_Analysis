# School_District_Analysis
Overview of the school district analysis:
Maria asked us to put together an analysis of passing test scores for reading and math for local high schools.  We were also tasked with identifying total school budge, per student budget, and school type. After we completed the initial analysis of the overall passing we were notified that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. It is suspected that the nineth grade class at Thomas High school has irregularities in their test results. Maria has asked me to remove those scores from the overall analysis and report back how the scores have changed
