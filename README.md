# School_District_Analysis
**Overview of the school district analysis:**

Maria asked us to put together an analysis of passing test scores for reading and math for local high schools.  We were also tasked with identifying total school budge, per student budget, and school type. After we completed the initial analysis of the overall passing we were notified that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. It is suspected that the nineth grade class at Thomas High school has irregularities in their test results. Maria has asked me to remove those scores from the overall analysis and report back how the scores have changed 

**Results**

If we format the results to one decimal pointe the results are not affected by removing Thomas Highschool 9th grade. For this case we would want to view the average further out to show the difference. We do see that for the medium schools the average passing grade has dropped slightly. The first graph is before removing the 9th grade class and the second is after removing the 9th grade class

We can also see that Charter school performance is increased slightly after removing the 9th grade class

We do not see a change is Thomas High school rankings compared to tother schools after removing the 9th grade class the first graph is before and the second is after and Thomas High school stays at 13th place

We would not see a change in scores by grade. After removing Thomas Highschool we have a chart that shows NaN to show there is no results for that school or grade

We did see a slight decrease in school size spending and type but only in medium schools, and Charter schools. Since Thomas Highschool is a medium charter school removing the 9th grade data would only affect those results.
